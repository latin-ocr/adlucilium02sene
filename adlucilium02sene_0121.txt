EPISTLE LXXIII.

and to the god who controls them, although in no
respect have they been apportioned for my benefit.
The foolish greed of mortals makes a distinction
between possession and ownershipfl and believes that
it has ownership in nothing in which the general
public has 3 share. But our philosopher considers
nothing more truly his own than that which he
shares in partnership with all mankind. For these
things would not be common property, as indeed
they are, unless every individual had his quota;
even a joint interest based upon the slightest share
makes one a partner. Again, the great and true
goods are not divided in such a manner that each
has but a slight interest; they belong in their
entirety to each individual. At a distribution of
grain men receive only the amount that has been
promised to each person3 the banquet and the meat-
dole,b or all else that 3 man can carry away with him,
are divided into parts. These goodS, however, are
indivisible,—I mean peace and liberty,—and they
belong in their entirety to all men just as much as
they belong to each individual.

Therefore the philosopher thinks of the person
who makes it possible for him to use and enjoy these
things, of the person who exempts him when the
state's dire need summons to arms, to sentry duty,
to the defence of the walls, and to the manifold
exactions of war3 and he gives thanks to the helms-
man of his state. This is what philosophy teaches
most of all,-— honourably to avow the debt of benefits
received, and honourably to payv them; sometimes,
however, the acknowledgment itself constitutes
payment. Our philosopher will therefore acknow-
ledge that he owes a larger debt to the ruler who
makes it possible, by his management and foresight,
