EPISTLE LXXXV.

squalls, inasmuch as he cannot carry out his purpose
and hold to his course3 as far as his art is concerned,
he becomes no worse a pilot, but in his work he
does become worse.'' To this the Peripatetics retort:
“Therefore, poverty will make even the wise man
worse, and so will pain, and so will anything else of
that sort. For although those things will not rob
him of his virtue, yet they will hinder the work of

become apparent. He who has been able to say,
“ Neptune, you shall never sink this ship except on
an even keel,’' ἶ) has fulfilled the requirements of his
art3 the storm does not interfere with the pilot’s
work, but only with his success. “What then,'’
you say, “ is not a pilot harmed by any circumstance
which does not permit him to make port, frustrates
all his efforts, and either carries him out to sea, or
