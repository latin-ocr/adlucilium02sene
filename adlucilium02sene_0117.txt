It seems to me erroneous to believe that those
who have loyally dedicated themselves to philosophy
are stubborn and rebellious, scorners of magistrates or
kings or of those who control 1116 3ἀ111111151131100 of
public affairs. For, on the contrary, no class of 111311

Besides, no man in public life thinks of the many
