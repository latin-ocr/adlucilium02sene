EPISTLE LXXII.

opens his jaws in the hope of something more. So
it is with ourselves; we stand expectant, and what-
ever Fortune has thrown to us we forthwith bolt,
without any real pleasure, and then stand alert and
frantie for something else to snatch.'' But it is not
so with the wise man; he is satisfied. Even if
something falls to him, he merely accepts it carelessly
and lays it aside. The happiness that he enjoys is
supremely great, is lasting, is his own. Assume that
a man has good intentions, and has made progress,
but is still far from the heights3 the result is a
series of ups and downs; he is now raised to heaven,
now brought down to earth. For those who lack
experience and training, there is no limit to the
downhill course; such a one falls into the Chaos ‘¹ of
Epicurus, —empty and boundless. There is still a
third class of men ,—those who toy with wisdom;

they have not indeed touched it, but yet are in sight
of it, and have it, so to speak, within striking dis-

tance. They are not dashed about, nor do they drift
back either; they are not on dry land, but are already
in port.

Therefore, considering the great difference be-
tween those on the heights and those in the depths,
and seeing that even those in the middle are pursued
by an ebb and flow peculiar to their state, and
pursued also by an enormous risk of returning to
their degenerate ways, we should not give ourselves
up to matters which occupy our time. They should
be shut out; if they once gain an entrance, they
will bring in still others to take then places. Let
us resist them in their earl3 stages. 1t is better
that they shall never begin than that they shall be
made to cease. Faieu ell.
