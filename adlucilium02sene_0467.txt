EPISTLE XCII.

walk as Ι should, or dine as 1 ought to dine, it is not
my dinner, or my walk, or my dress that are goods,
but the deliberate choice which I show in regard to
them, as Ι observe, in each thing Ι (10, 3 mean that

believe,—that the man who is in the midst of un-
remitting and extreme pain is not wretched, nay, is
even happy3 and you deny that which is much less
