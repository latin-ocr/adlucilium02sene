LXXXVIII. ON LIBERAL AND
VOCATIONAL STUDIES

You have been wishing to know my views with
regard to liberal studies.a My answer is this: 1
respect no study, and deem no study good, which
results in money-making. Such studies are profit-
bringing oceupations, useful only in so far as they
give the mind a preparation and do not engage it
permanently. One should linger upon them only
so long as the mind can occupy itself with nothing
greater3 they are our appr-euticeship‚ not our real
work. Hence you see why “ liberal studies” are so
called3 it is because they are studies worthy of a
free-born gentleman. But there is only one really
liberal study,—that which gives a man his liberty.
It is the study of wisdom, and that is lofty‚ brave,
and great-souled. All other studies are puny and
puerile. You surely do not believe that there is
good in any of the subjects whose teachers are, as
you see, men of the most ignoble and base stamp?
We ought not to be learning such things3 we

should have done with learning them.
¹ Certain persons have made up their minds that
ζ the point at issue with regard to the liberal studies
¹, is whether they make men good3 but they do not
=' even profess or aim at a knowledge of this particular
