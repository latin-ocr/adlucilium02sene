EPISTLE LXXXVIII.

begin along with the universe, or, because there was
something even before the universe began, did time
also exist then? There are countless questions con-
cerning the soul alone: whence it comes, what is
its nature, when it begins to exist, and how long it
exists; whether it passes from one place to another
and changes its habitation, being transferred succes-

how it will employ its freedom when it has escaped
from this present prison ; whether it will forget all its
past, and at that moment begin to know itself when,
released from the body, it has withdrawn to the skies.

a lavish display of costly objectS, but do not deem
him blameworthy who has allowed himself to become
engrossed with the useless furniture of learning?
This desire to know more than is sufficient is a sort
