EPISTLE LXX.

speedily as possible ; otherwise, there will be no lack
of persons who will think ill of what you have done.

You can find men who have gone so far as to
profess wisdom and yet maintain that one should not
offer violence to one's own life, and hold it accursed

in it as if you were about to leave it. Keep thinking
of the fact that some day you will be deprived of
this tenure3 then you will be more brave against
the necessity of departing. But how will a man
