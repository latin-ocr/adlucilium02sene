EPISTLE LXXXV.

This is speed estimated by its own standard, not
the kind which wins praise by comparison with that
which is slowest. Would you 6311 3 111311 well who
has a light 6356 of fever? No, for good health does
not mean moderate illness. They say, “The wise
man is called unperturbed in the sense in which
pomegranates are called mellow—-not that there is
no hardness at all in their seeds, but that the hardness
is less than it was before.” That view is wrong;
for I am not referring to the gradual weeding 0111 of
evils in a good man, but to the complete absence
of evils; there should be in him no evils at all,
and not some small ones. For if there are any,
they will grow, and as they grow will hamper him.
Just as 3 large and complete 63131361 ‘¹ wholly blinds
the eyes, so 3 medium-sized cataract dulls their
vislon.

If by your definition the wise man 1135 any
passions whatever, his reason will be no match for
them and will be carried swiftly along, as it were,
ἶ 011 3 rushing stream,—-—particularly if you assign 10
him, 1101 0116 passion with which he must wrestle,
but 311 1116 passions. And 3 throng of such, even
though they be moderate, 6311 affect him more than
the violence of one powerful passion. He has 3
craving for money, although in a moderate degree.
He has ambition, but it is not yet fully aroused. He
has a hot temper, but it can be appeased. He has
inconstancy, but not the kind that is very capricious
or easily set in motion. He has lust, but not the
violent kind. We could deal better with 3 person
who possessed one full—fledged vice, than with one
who possessed all the vices, but 110116 of them in
extreme form. Again, it makes no difference how
great the passion is; 110 11131161 what its size may
