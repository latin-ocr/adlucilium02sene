EPISTLES LXXXII, LXXXIII.

toughness which matched its bulk, made spears, or
any weapon hurled by the hand of man, glance off.
It was finally destroyed by rocks equal in size to mill-
stones. Are you, then, hurling petty weapons like
yours even against death? Can you stop a lion’s
charge by an awl Ρα Your arguments are indeed
sharp3 but there is nothing sharper than a stall< of
grain. And certain arguments are rendered useless
and unavailing by their very subtlety. F arewell.

LXXXIII. ΟΝ DRUNKENNESS

You bid me give you an account of each separate
day, and of the whole day too3 so you must have a
good opinion of me if you think that in these days of
mine there is nothing to hide. At any rate, it is
thus that we should live‚—as if we lived in plain
sight of all men3 and it is thus that we should think,
—as if there were someone who could look into our
inmost souls; and there is one who can so look. For
what avails it that something is hidden from man?
Nothing is shut off from the sight of God. He is
witness of our souls,b and he comes into the very
midst of our thoughts—comes into them, Ι say, as one
who may at any time depart. Ι shall therefore do
as you bid, and shall gladly inform you by letter
what Ι am doing, and in what sequence. I shall
keep watching myself continually, and—a most useful
habit—shall review each day.c For this is what
makes us wicked: that no one of us looks back over
his own life. Our thoughts are devoted only to what
we are about to do. And yet our plans for the future

· always depend on the past.
