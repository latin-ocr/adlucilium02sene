EPISTLE LXXXVII.

in evils through riches or through pleasure3 other-
wise, if it is through riches that we become involved
in many evils, riches are not only not a good, but
they are positively an evil. You, however, maintain
merely that they are not a good. Moreover,'’ the
objector sayS, “you grant that riches are of some
use. You reckon them among the advantages; and
yet on this basis they cannot even be an advan-
tage, for it is through the pursuit of riches that we
suffer much disadvantage.” Certain men answer this
objection as follows: “ You are mistaken if you ascribe
disadvantages to riches. Riches injure no one ; it is
a man’s own folly, or his neighbour's wickedness, that
harms him in each case, just as a sword by itself does
not slay; it is merely the weapon used by the slayer.
Riches themselves do not harm you, just because it
is on account of riches that you suffer harm.'’

Ι think that the reasoning of Posidonius is better:
he holds that riches are a cause of evil, not because,
of themselves, they do any evil, bnt because they
goad men on so that they are ready to do evil. For
the efficient cause, which necessarily produces barm
at once, is one thing, and the antecedent cause is
another. Itis this antecedent cause which inheres
in riches3 they puff up the spirit and beget pride,
they bring on unpopularity and unsettle the mind
to such an extent that the mere reputation of having
wealth, though it is bound to harln us, nevertheless
affords delight. All goods, however, ought properly
to be free from blame3 they are pure, they do not
corrupt the spirit, and they do not tempt us. They
do, indeed, uplift and broaden the spirit, but without
puffing it up. Those things which are goods produce
confidence, but riches produce shamelessness. The
things which are goods give us greatness of soul,
