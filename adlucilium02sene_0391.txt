EPISTLE LXXXIX.

——namely, the parts of philosophy and the division
of its huge bulk into separate members. For by
studying the parts we can be brought more easily to
understand the whole. Ι only wish that philosophy
might come before our eyes in all her unity, just
as the whole expanse of the firmament is spread out
for us to gaze upon! It would be a sight closely
resembling that of the firmament. For then surely
philosophy would ravish all mortals with love for hera ;
we should abandon all those things which, in our
ignoranee of what is great, we believe to be great.
Inasmuch, however, as this cannot fall to our lot, we
must view philosophy just as men gaze upon the
secrets of the firmament.

The wise man's mind, to be sure, embraces the
whole framework of philosophy, surveying it with
no less rapid glauce than our mortal eyes survey the
heavens; we, however, who must break through the
gloom, we whose vision fails even for that which is
near at hand, can be shown with greater ease each
separate object even though we cannot yet coni-
prehend the universe. I shall therefore coinply
with your demand, and shall divide philosophy into
parts, but not into scraps. For it is useful that
philosophy should be divided, but not chopped into
bits. Just as it is hard to take in what is indefinitely
large, so it is hard to take in what is indefinitely
small. The people are divided into tribes, the army
into centuries. Whatever has grown to greater size
is inore easily identified if it is broken up into parts;
but the parts, as Ι have remarked‚ must not be
countless 111 number and diminutive in size. For
over-analysis is faulty in precisely the same way as
no analysis at all3 whatever you cut so fine that it
becomes dust is as good as blended into a mass again.⁶
