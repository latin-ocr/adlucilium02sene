EPISTLE XC.

together in close-united fellowship. Philosophy has
taught us to worship that which is divine, to love
that which is human‘ffl she has told us that with
the gods lies dominion, and among 111611, fellowship.
This fellowship relnained unspoiled for a long time,
until avarice tore the community asunder and became
the cause of poverty, even in the case of those whom
she herself had most enriched. For men cease to
possess all things the moment they desire all things
for their own.

But the first 111611 311(1 those who sprang from
them, still unspoiled, followed nature, having one
man as both their leader and their law, entrusting
themselves to the control of one better than them-
selveS. For nature has the habit of subjecting 1116
weaker to the stronger. Even among the dumb
animals those which are either biggest or fiercest
hold sway. It is no weakling bull that leads the
herd; it is one that has beaten the other males by
his might and his muscle. In the case of elephants,
the tallest goes first; among 111611, 1116 best is regarded
as the highest. That 13 why it was to the mind that
3 ruler was assigned ; and for that reason the greatest
happiness rested with those peoples among whom
a 111311 could not be the more powerful unless 116
were the better. For that man 6311 safely accomplish
what he will who thinks he cannot do that which
he ought not to do.

Accordingly, in that age which is maintained
to be the golden agef' Posidonius0 holds that the
government was under the jurisdiction of the wise.

there is much in common between Posidonius and the
English inductive philosopher. and thinks but little of
Seneca's ideas on the subject. Cf. W. C. Summers, Seleet
Lateo-s of Seneca, p. 31⁶2.
