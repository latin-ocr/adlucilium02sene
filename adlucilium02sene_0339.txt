EPISTLE LXXXVII.

have uttered an opinion counter to that in which
mankind believe, saying, “You are mad, you are
misled, your admiration devotes itself to superfluous
things! You estimate no man at his real worth.
When property is concerned, you reckon up in this
way with most scrupulous calculation those to whom
you shall lend either money οι· benefits; for by now
you enter benefits also as payments in your ledger.
You say: ‘ His estates are wide, but his debts
are larges ‘He has a fine house, but he has
built it on borrowed capital.’ ‘ No man will display
a more brilliant retinue on short notice, but he
cannot meet his debts.' ‘¹ ‘If he pays off his
creditors, he will have nothing left! ” So you will
feel bound to do in all other cases as well,-to find
out by elimination the amount of every man's actual
possessions.

I suppose you call a man rich just because his gold
plate goes with him even on his travels, because he
farms land in all the provinces, because he unrolls a
large account-book, because he owns estates near the
city so great that men would grudge his holding them
in the waste lands of Apulia. But after you have
mentioned all these facts, he is poor. And why?
He is in debt. “To what extent?” you ask. For
all that he has. Or perchance you think it matters
whether one has borrowed from another man or from
Fortune. What good is there in mules caparisoned
in uniform livery? Or in decorated chariots and

Steeds decked with purple and with tapestry,
With golden harness hanging from their necks,
Champing their yellow bits, all clothed in gold?⁶

Neither master nor mule is improved by such
trappings.
