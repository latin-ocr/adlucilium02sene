EPISTLES LXX., LXXI.

Reason, too, advises us to die, if we may, according
to our taste3 if this cannot be, she advises us to die
according to our ability, and to seize upon whatever
means shall offer itself for doing violence to our-
selves. It is crimina] to “live by robberv'’‘¹'; but,
on the other hand, it is most noble to “die bv
robbery.'' Farewell. ‘

LXXI. ΟΧ ΤΗΕ SUPREME GOOD

You are continually referring special questions to
me, forgetting that a vast stretch of sea sunders us.
Since, however, the value of advice depends inostly
on the time when it is given, it must necessarily
result that by the time my opinion on certain matters
reaches you, the opposite opinion is the better. For
advice conforms to circumstances; and our circum-
stances 'are carried along, or rather whirled along.
Accordingly, advice should be produced at short
notice3 and even this is too late; it should “grow
while we work,” as the saying is. And Ι propose
to show you how you may discover the method.

As often as you wish to know what is to be
avoided or what is to be sought, consider its relation
to the Supreme Good, to the purpose of your whole
life. For whatever we do ought to be in harmony
with this3 no man can set in order the details unless
he has already set before himself the chief purpose
of his life. The artist may have his colours all
prepared, but he cannot produce a likeness unless
he has already made up his mind what he wishes to
paint.b The reason we make mistakes is because we all
consider the parts of life, but never life as a whole.
