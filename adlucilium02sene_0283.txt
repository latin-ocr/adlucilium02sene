EPISTLE LXXXIII.

how often the drunkard does things which make him
blush when he is sober, · state that drunkennessa is
nothing but a condition of insanity purposely assumed.
Prolong the drunkard’ 3 condition to several da)s;

will you have any doubt about his madness? Ev en
as it is, the madness is no less; it merely lasts a
shorter time. Think of Alexander of Maced0n,b who
stabbed Clitus, his dearest and most loyal friend,
at a banquet3 after Alexander understood what he
had done, he wished to die, and assuredly he ought
to have died.

Drunkenness kindles and discloses every kind of
vice, and removes the sense of shame that veils our
evil undertakings.⁰ For more men abstain from
forbidden actions because they are ashamed of sinning
than because their inclinations aie good. W hen the
strength of wine has become too great and has gained
control over the mind, every lurking evil comes forth
from its hiding- place. Drunkenness does not create
vice, it merely brings it into view, · at such times the
lustful man does not wait ev en for the priv acy of a
bedroom, but without postponement gives free pla)
to the demands of his passions; at such times the
unchaste man proclaims and publishes his malady3
at such times your cross-grained fellow does not
restrain his tongue or his hand. The haughty man
increases his arrogance, the ruthless man his cruelty‚
the slanderer his spitefulness. Every vice is given
free play and comes to the front. Besides, we forget
who we are, we utter words that are halting and
poorly enunciated‚ the glance is unsteady, the step
falterS, the head is dizzy‚ the very ceiling moves
ἵ about as if a cyclone were whirling the whole house,

¹ and the stomach suffers torture when the wine

generates gas and causes our very bowels to swell.
