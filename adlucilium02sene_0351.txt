EPISTLE LXXXV 11.

an act of sacrilege, the money does not on that account
derive its origin from sacrilege. You may get my mean-
ing through the following illustration: In the same
jar there is a piece of gold and there is a serpent.
If you take the gold from the jar, it is not just
because the serpent is there too, I say, that the jar
yields me the gold—because it contains the serpent
as welL-but it yields the gold in spite of contain-
ing the serpent also. Similarly, gain results from
sacrilege, not just because sacrilege is a base and
accursed act, but because it contains gain also. As
the serpent in the jar is an evil, and not the gold
which lies there beside the serpent3 so in an act of
sacrilege it is the crime, not the profit, that is evil.”
But I differ from these men; for the conditions
in each case are not at all the same In the one
instance I can take the gold without the serpent,
in the other I cannot make the profit without com-
mitting the sacrilege. The gain in the latter case
does not lie side by side with the crime ; it is blended
with the crime.

“ That which, while we are desiring to attain it,
involves us in many evils, is not a good. But while
we are desiring to attain riches, we become involved
in many evils3 therefore, riches are not a good.'’“
“ Your first premiss,” they say, “ contains two mean-
ings3 one is: we become involved in many evils
while we are desiring to attain riches. But we also
become involved in many evils while we are desiring
to attain virtue. One man, while travelling in order
to prosecute his studies, suffers shipwreck, and
another is taken captive. The second meaning is
as follows: that through which we become involved
in evils is not a good. And it will not logically
follow from our proposition that we become involved
