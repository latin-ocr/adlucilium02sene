exists of all this which seems to exist, except the
universe 310110.α Zeno of Elea removed all the
difficulties by removing one; for he declares that
nothing exists. The Pyrrhonean, Megarian, Eretrian,
and Academic schools are all engaged in practically
the same task3 they have introduced a new know-

ledge, non· knowledge. You may sweep all these
theories in with the superfluous troops of‘ liberal'’

studies· ‚ the one class of men give me a knowledge
that will be of no use to me, the other class do
away with any hope of attaining knowledge. Itis
better, of course, to know useless things than to
know nothing. One set of philosophers offers no
light by which Ι may direct my gaze toward the
truth3 the other digs out my very eyes and leaves
me blind. If Ι cleave to ProtagoraS, there is nothing
in the scheme of nature that is not doubtful; if Ι
hold with Nausiphanes, I am sure only of this-that
everything is unsure; if with Parmenides, there is
nothing except the One ζ’; if with Zeno, there is not
even the One.

What are we, then? What becomes of all these
things that surround 115, support us, sustain us?
The whole universe 15 then a vain or deceptive
shadow. I cannot readily say whether Ι am more
vexed at those who would have it that we know
nothing, or with those who would not leave us even
this privilege. Farewell.
