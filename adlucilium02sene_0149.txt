EPISTLES LXXIV„ LXXV.

unless he has leaped over the intervening years,
and has projected himself into the trouble that is
destined to arrive a generation later. In the same
way, souls that enjoy being sick and that seize upon
excuses for sorrow 316 saddened by events long past
and effaced from the records. Past and future are
both absent; we feel neither of them. But there

feel. Farewell.

LXXV. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DISEASES OF THE SOUL

You have been complaining that my letters to
you are rather carelessly written. Now who talks
carefully unless he also desires to talk affectedlya?
Ι prefer that my letters should be just what my
conversationb would be if you and I wele sitting in
one another s company or taking walks together, —
spontaneous and easy; for my letters have nothing
strained or artificial about them. If it were possible,
I should prefer to show, rather 111311 speak, my
feelings. Even if Ι were arguing 3 point, Ι should
not stanip my foot, or 1033 my arms about, or 13136
my voice ; but Ι should leave that sort of thing to 1116
013101, and should be content to have conveyed my
feelings to you without having either embellished
them or lowered their dignity. I should like to
convince you entirer of this one fact,——that Ι feel
whatever Ι say, that Ι 1101 only feel it, but am
wedded to it. It is 0116 3011 of kiss which a man
gives his mistress, and another which 116 gives his
children3 yet in the father's embrace also, holy and
restrained as it is, plenty of affection is disclosed.
