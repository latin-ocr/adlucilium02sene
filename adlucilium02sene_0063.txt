EPISTLE LXVIII.

falling back upon the maxims of Epicurus! '’ a l do
recommend retirement to you, but only that you may
use it for greater and more beautiful activities than
those which you have resigned3 to knock at the
haughty doors of the influential, to make alphabetical
lists of childless old men, ὸ to wield the highest author-
ity in public life, —this kind of pou er exposes you to
han-‚ed is short· lived and, if you rate it at its true
value, is tawdry. One m an shall be far abead of me as
regards his influence in public life,51'nother ln salary
as an army officer and in the position which results
from this, another in the throng of his clients; but it is
worth while to be outdone by all these men, provided
that I my self can outdo Fortune. And I am no match
for her in the throng· ‚ she has the greater backing.c
Would that in earlier days you had been minded
to follow this purpose! u‘ ould that we u ere not
discussing the happy life in plain view of death!
But even now let us have no delay. For now wc
can take the word of experience, which tells us that
there are many superfluous and hostile things3 for
this we should long since have taken the word of
reason. Let us do what men are wont to do when
they are late in setting forth, and wish to make up
for lost time by increasing their speed—let us ply
the spur. Our time of life is the best possible for
these pursuits; for the period of boiling and foaming
is now past.d The faults that were uncontrolled in
the first fierce heat of youth are now weakened, and
but little further effort is needed to extinguish them.
“And w hen‚” you ask, x“vill tl151t profit you
which you do not learn until your departur‚e and
how will it profit you Ρ Precisely in this way that
I shall depart a better man. You need not think,
