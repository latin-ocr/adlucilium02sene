EPISTLE LXXXVIII.

Posidoniusa divides the arts into four classes:
first we have those which are common and low, then
those which serve for amusement, then those which
refer to the education of boys, and, finally, the liberal
arts. The common sort belong to workmen and are
mere hand-work 3 they are concerned with equipping
life; there is in them no pretence to beauty or
honour. The arts of amusement are those which
aim to please the eye and the ear. To this class

then fall apart, or objects which are separate then
join together automatically, or objects which stand
erect then gradually collapse. 'I'he eye of the
inexperienced is struck with amazemcnt by these
things; for such persons marvel at evcrything that

edueation of boys, and are somewhat similar to the
liberal arts‚ are those which the Greeks call the
“cycle of studies,” b but which we Romans call the
“liberal'’ However, those alone are really liberal
-or rather, to give them a truer name, “free ’'—
whose concern is virtue. -

philosophy which has to do with nature, and a part
which has to do with ethics, and a part which lias to
do with reasoning‚ so this group of liberal arts also
claims for itself a place in philosophy. When one
approaches questions that deal with nature, a decision
is reached by means of a word from the inathe-
niatician. Therefore mathematics is a department
of that branch which it aids.''⁰ But many things
