EPISTLE LXXXII

think that Zeno' s syllogisma is correct, but that the
seconda Ι mentioned, which is set up against his, is
’ deceptive and wrong But I f01 my part decline to
reduce such questions to a matter of dialectica] rules or
to the subtleties of an utterly soulless system. Away,
I say, with all that sort of thing, which makes a man

and to retreat from life rather than from their post?
Shall you say: “That which is evil is not glorious;
but death is glorious ; therefore death is not an evil ” ?
¹ What a powerful discourse! After such words, who
would hesitate to throw himself upon the serried
spears of the foemen, and die in his tracks? But
take Leonidas: how bravely did he address his men l
He said: “Fellow-soldiers, let us to our breakfast,
knowing that we shall sup in Hades ! ’¹ ‘l The food
