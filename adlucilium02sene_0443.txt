XCI. ΟΝ ΤΙ-ΙΕ LESSON TO BE DRAWN
FROM THE BURNING OF LYONSa

Our friend Liberalisb is now downcast3 for he
has just heard of the fire which has wiped out the
colony of Lyons. Such a calamity might upset any-
one at all, not to speak of a man who dearly loves
his country. But this incident has served to make
him inquire about the strength of his own character,
which he has trained, Ι suppose, just to meet situations
that he thought might cause him fear. I do not
wonder, however, that he was free from apprehension
touching an evil so unexpected and practically unheard
of as this, since it is without precedent. For fire has
damaged many a city, but has annihilated none.
Even when fire has been hurled against the walls by
the hand of a foe, the {lame dies out in many places,
and although continually renewed, rarely devours so
wholly as to leave nothing for the sword. Even
an earthquake has scarcely ever been so violent and
destructive as to overthrow whole cities. Finally,
no conflagration has ever before blazed forth so
savagely in any town that nothing was left for a
second. So many beautiful buildings, any single
one of which would make 3 single town famous,
were wrecked in one night. In time of such deep
peace an event has taken place worse than men can
possibly sear even in time of war. Who can believe

ὁ Probably Aebutius Liberalis. to whom the treatise De
Beneficiis was dedicated.
