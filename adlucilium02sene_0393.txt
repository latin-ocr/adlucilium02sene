EPISTLE LXXXIX.

In the first place, therefore, if you appi-ove, I
shall draw the distinction between wisdom and
philosophy. Wisdom is the perfect good of the
human mind; philosophy is the love of wisdom, and
the endeavour to attain it. The latter strives toward
the goal which the former has already reached.
And it is clear why philosophy was so called. For
it acknowledges by its very name the object of its
lovea Certain persons have defined wisdom as the
knowledge of things divine and things humans)
Still others say: “Wisdom is knowing things divine
and things human, and their causes also.’' ⁰ This
added phrase seems to me to be superfluous, since
the causes of things divine and things human are a
part of the divine system. Philosophy also has been
defined in various ways; some have called it “ the
study of virtue,‘' ‘l others have referred to it as “a
study of the way to amend the mind,’'⁰ and some
have named it “the search for right reason.⁷’ One
thing is practically settled, that there is some
difference between philosophy and wisdom. Nor
indeed is it possible that that which is sought
and that which seeks are identical. As there is a
great difference between avarice and wealth, the
one being the subject of the craving and the other
its object, so between philosophy and wisdom. For
the one is a result and a reward of the other.
Philosophy does the going, and wisdom is the goal.
Wisdom is that which the Greeks call σοφία. The
Romans also were wont to use this word in the sense
in which they now use “ philosophy’' also. This
will be proved to your satisfaction by our old national

d The ἄσκησις ἀρετῆς of the earlier Stoics. Seneca (Frag.
17) also calls it recca vivendi ratio.
⁶ i.e.‚ to make a bona mens out of a mala mens.
