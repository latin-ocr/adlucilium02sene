EPISTLE LXXI.

all when he pays the penalty for keeping his word
even with his enemies. And yet no man, even
the most effeminate person in the world, has ever
dared to maintain such an opinion For though
such persons deny that a inan like Regulus is

Any change in the rule means spoiling the straight
line. Applying, therefore, this same figure to virtue,
we shall say: Virtue also is straight, and admits of
no bending. What can be made more tense than a
thing which is already rigid? Such is virtue, which
passes judgment on everything, but nothing passes
judgment on virtue. And if this rule, virtue, cannot
