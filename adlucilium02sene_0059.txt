EPISTLE LXVIII.

you,——-that you keep your retirement in the back-
ground. There is no need to fasten a placard upon
yourself with the words ε “ Philosopher and Quietist.''
Give your purpose some other name ; call it ill-health
and bodily weakness, or mere lazineSS. 'l‘o boast of our
retirement is but idle sels-seeking. Certain animals
hide themselves from discovery by confusing the marks
of their foot-prints in the neighbourhood of their
lairs. You should do the same. Otherwise, there
will always be someone dogging your footsteps,
Many men pass by that which is visible, and peer
after things hidden and concealed ; a locked room in-
vites the thies. Things which lie in the open appear
cheap3 the house-breaker passes by that which is
exposed to view. This is the way of the world, and
the way of all ignorant men: they crave to burst in
upon hidden thingS. It is therefore best not to
vaunt one’s retirement. It is, however, a sort of vaunt-
ing to make too much of one’s concealment and of
one's withdrawal from the sight of men. So-and-so a
has gone into his retreat at 'l'arentu1n3 that other
man has shut himself up at Naples; this third person
for many years has not crossed the threshold of his
own house. T 0 adv er tise one’ s retirement 1s to collect
a crowd. W hen you withdraw from the world, your
business is to talk with y·oulself, not to have men
talk about you But w h 1t shall you talk about? Do
just what people are fond of doing when they talk
about their neighboulqs —speak ill of y·ouiself when
by y;ourself then you will become accustomed both
to speak and to hear the truth Above all, however,
ponde1 that which you come to feel is your greatest
weakness. Each man knows best the defects of his
own body. And so one relieves his stomach by
'’vomiting, another props it up by frequent eating‚
