EPISTLE LXVI.

and toil. Or, if you do this, you will, in the case of
two equally good men, care more for him who is
neat and well-groomed than for him who is dirty and
unkempt. You would next go so far as to care more
for a good man who is sound in all his limbs and
without blemish‚ than for one who is weak or maimed:
and gradually your fastidiousness would reach such a
point that, of two equally just and prudent men,
you would choose him who has long curling hair!
thenever the virtue in each one is equal, the in-
equality in their other attributes is not apparent.
For all other things are not parts, but merely

not necessarily love more deeply those of her works
which she beholds in trouble and under heavy
burdens, but, like good parents, she gives them
more of her fostering care.

Why is no good greater than any othei good?
