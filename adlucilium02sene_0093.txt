EPISTLE LXXI.

ment? For what is free from the risk of change?
Neither earth, nor sky, nor the whole fabric of our
universe, though it be controlled by the hand of
God. It will not always preserve its present order;
it will be thrown from its course in days to comest
All things move in accord with their appointed
times; they are destined to be born, to groxv, and
to be destroyed. The stars which you see moving
above us, and this seemingly immovable earth to
which we cling and on which we are set, will be
consumed and will cease to exist. There is nothing
that does not have its old age; the intervals are
merely unequal at which Nature sends forth all these
things towards the same goal. &Vhatever is will
cease to be, and yet it will not perish, but will be
resolved into its elements. To our minds, this
process means perishing, for we behold only that
which is nearest ; our sluggish mind, under allegiance
to the body, does not penetrate to bournes beyond.
VVere it not so, the mind would endure with greater
courage its own ending and that of its possessions,
if only it could hope that life and death, like the
whole universe about us, go by turns, that whatever
has been put together is broken up again, that
whatever has been broken up is put together again,
and that the eternal craftsmanship of God, who
controls all things, is working at this task.

Therefore the wise man will say just what a
Marcus Cato would say, after reviewing his past life z
“The whole race of man, both that which is and
that which is to be, is condemned to die. Of all
the cities that at any time have held sway over the
world, and of all that have been the splendid orna-
ments of empires not their own, men shall some day
ask where they were, and they shall be swept away
