EPISTLE XCII.

of difference whether there is merely something in
the way of his light or something which intel-feres
with his shining. Silnilarly, obstacles take nothing
away from virtue; it is no smaller, but merely shines
with less brilliancy. In our eyes, it may perhaps be

regards itself it is the same and, like the sun when
he is echpsed, is still, though in secret, putting forth

is not desii-able? And what is so far beyond the
bounds of credence as the opinion that any life is
neither desirable nor undesirable? Again, if bodily
