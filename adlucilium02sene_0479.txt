is equal to the gods 3 mindful of his origin, he strives
to return thither. No man does wrong 111 attempting
to regain the heights from which he once came
down. And why should you not believe that some-
thing of divinity exists in one who is a part of God ?
All this universe which encompasses us is one, and
it is God3 we are associates of God3 we are his
members. Our soul has calmbilities, and is carried
thither,b if vices do not hold it down. Just as it is
the nature of our bodies to stand erect and look
upward to the sky, so the seul, which may reach
out as far as it will, was framed by nature to this
end, that it should desire equality with the gods.
And if it makes use of its powers and stretches
upward into its proper region it is by no alien path
that it struggles toward the heights. It would be
a great task to journey heavenward53 the soul but
returns thither. When once it has found the road,
it boldly marolles on, scornful of all things. It casts
no backward glance at wealth; gold and silver—
things which are fully worthy of the gloom in
which they once lay—-it values not by the sheen
which smites the eyes of the ignorant, but by the
mire of ancient days, whence our greed first detached
and dug them out.

The soul, I affirm, knows that riches are stored
elsewhere than in men’s heaped-up treasure-houses3
that it is the soul, and not the strong-box, which
should be filled. It is the soul that men may set
in dominion over all things, and may install as owner
of the universe, so that it may limit its riches only
