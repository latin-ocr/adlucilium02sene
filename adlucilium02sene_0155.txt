EPISTLE LXXV.

but not yet the passions, and as still standing upon
slippery ground3 because 110 0116 is beyond the
dangers of evil except him who has cleared himself
of it wholly. But no one has so cleared himself
except the man who has adopted wisdom in its stead.

I have often before explained the difference
between the diseases of the mind and its passions.
And Ι shall remind you once more: the diseases are
hardened and chronic vices, such as greed and
ambition; they have enfolded the mind in too close
a grip, and have begun to be permanent evils
thereos. To give a brief definition: by “disease”
we mean a persistent perversion of the judgnient, so
that things which are mildly desirable are thought
to be highly desirable. Or, if you prefer, we may
define it thus: to be too zealous in striving for things
which are only mildly desirable or not desirable at
all, 01· to value highly things which ought to be
valued but slightly or valued not at all. “ Passions '’
are objectionable impulses of the spirit, sudden and
vehement3 they have come so often, and so little
attention has been paid to them, that they have
caused a state of disease; just as a catarrhf‘ when
there has been but a single attack and the. catal-rh
has not yet become habitual, produces a cough, but
causes consumption when it has become regular and
chronic. Therefore 116 may say that those who
have made most progress are bex ond the reach of
the‘ ‘diseases ''; but they still feel the ‘passions ’'
even when very near per fection.

The second class is composed of those who have
laid aside both the greatest ills of the mind and its
passfions, but yet are not in assured possession of
immunity.b For they can still slip back into their
former state. The third class are beyond the reach
