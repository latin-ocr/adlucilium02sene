EPISTLE LXXXVII.

must perforce admit that sacrilege, though it be an
evil because it works much evil, is yet partly good
because it accomplishes a certain amount of good.
What can be more monstrous than this? We have,
to be sure, actually convinced the world that sacrilege,
theft, and adultery are to be regarded as among the

goods. How many men there are who do not blush
’ at theft, how many who boast of having committed
adultery! For petty sacrilege is punished, but
sacrilege on a grand scale is honoured bya triumpha]
procession. Resides, sacrilege, if it is really good in
some respect, will also be honourable and will be
called right conduct ; for it is conduct which concerns
ourselves. But no human being, on serious con-
sideration, admits this idea.

Therefore, goods cannot spring from evil. For
if, as you object, sacrilege is an evil for the single
reason that it brings on much evil, if you but absolve
sacrilege of its pubnishment and pledge it immunity,
sacrilege will be wholly good. And yet the worst
punishment for crime lies in the crime itself. You
are mistaken, I maintain, if you propose to reserve
your punishments for the hangman or the prison3

the crime is punished immediately after it is com-
* mitted; nay, rather, at the moment when it is
³ committed. Hence, good does not spring from evil,
any more than figs grow from olive-trees. Things
which grow correspond to their seed; and goods
cannot depart from their class. As that which is
honourable does not grow from that which is base, so
neither does good grow from evil. For the honour-
able and the good are identicalfl

Certain of our school oppose this statement as

source whatsoever is a good3 even though it is takenby
