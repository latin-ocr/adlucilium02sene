EPISTLE LXXVIII.

the limits of good and evil; then, and then only,
life will not wear-y us, neither will death make us
afraid. For surfeit‘of self can never seize upon a life
that surveys all the' things which are manifold, great,
divine; only idle leisure is wont to make men hate
their lives. To one who roams a through the universe,
the truth can never pall3 it will be the untruths
that will eloy. And, on the other hand, if death
comes near with its summons, even though it be un-
timely in its arrival, though it cut one off in one’s
prime, a man has had a taste of all that the longest
life can give. Such a man has in great measure
come to understand the universe. He knows that
honourable things do not depend on time for their
growth3 but any life must seem short to those who
measure its length by pleasures which are empty and
for that reason unbounded.

Refresh yourself with such thoughts as these, and
meanwhile reserve some hours for our letters. There
will come a time when we shall be united again and
brought together; however short this time may be,
we shall make it long by knowing how to employ it.
For, as Posidonius saysbz “A single day among the
learned lasts longer than the longest life of the
ignorant.’' Meanwhile, hold fast to this thought,
and grip it close: yield not to adversity3 trust not
to prosperity; keep before your eyes the full scope of
Fortune’s power, as if she would surely do whatever
is in her power to do. That which has been long
expected comes more gently. Farewell.
