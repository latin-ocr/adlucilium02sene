EPISTLE LXXIX.

and he were not well known to the public; but he
declares that after the lifetime of Epicurus and him-
self any man who might wish to follow in their foot-
steps would win great and ready-made renown.

Virtue is never lost to view ; and yet to have been
lost to view is no loss. There will come a day which
will reveal her, though hidden away or suppressed
by the spite of her contemporaries. That man is
born merely for a few, who thinks only of the
people of his own generation. Many thousands of
years and many thousands of peoples will come after
you3 it is to these that you should have regard.
Malice may have imposed silence upon the mouths
of all who were alive in your day; but there will
come men who will judge you without prejudice and
without favour. If there is any reward that virtue
receives at the hands of fame, not even this can pass
away. We ourselves, indeed, shall not be affected
by the talk of posterity3 nevertheless, posterity will
cherish and celebrate us even though we are not
conscious thereos. Virtue has never failed to reward
a man, both during his life and after his death, pro-
vided he has followed her loyally, provided he has
not decked himself out or painted himself up, but
has been always the same, whether he appeared
before men's eyes after being announced, or suddenly
and without preparation. Pretence accomplishes
nothing. Few are deceived by a mask that is easily
drawn over the face. Truth is the same in every
part. Things which deceive us have no real sub-
stance. Lies are thin stuff3 they are transparent,
¹ if you examine them with care. Farewell.
