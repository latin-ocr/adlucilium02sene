not yet followed. And even if this were the case,
I should not have these principles so ready for
practice, or so well trained, that they would rush to
my assistance in every crisis. Just as wool takes up
certain colours at 01100,α while there are others

will be clarified. It will be in keeping with this
judgment to judge all things that have been coloured
