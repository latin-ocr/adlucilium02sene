EPISTLE LXX.

LXX. ΟΝ THE PROPER TIME TO SLIP
THE CABLE

After a long space of time Ι have seen your
beloved Pompeii.‘¹ I was thus brought again face to
face with the days of my youth. And it seemed to

weary and sick of the slow-moving calum while
others are carried quickly home by steady gales.

rapidity to the harbour, the harbour they were bound
to reach even if they tarried on the way, while others
it has fretted and harassed. To such a life, as you
