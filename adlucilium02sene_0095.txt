EPISTLE LXXI.

by destructions of various kinds; some shall be
ruined by wars, others shall be wasted away by
inactivity and by the kind of peace which ends in
sloth, or by that vice which is fraught with destruc-
tion even for mighty dynastieS,—luxury. All these
fertile plains shall be buried out of sight by a sudden
overflowing of the sea, or a slipping of the soil, as it
settles to lower levels, shall draw them suddenly
into a yawning chasm. Why then should Ι be
angry or feel sorrow, if I precede the general
destruction by a tiny interval of time ζ’ ” Let great
souls comply with God’s wishes, and suffer un-
hesitatingly whatever fate the law of the universe
ordains3 for the soul at death is either sent forth
into a better life, destined to dwell with deity amid
greater radiance and calm, or else, at least, without
suffering any harm to itself, it will be mingled with
nature again, and will return to the universe.“
Therefore Cato's honourable death was no less η
good than his honourable life, since virtue admits of
no stretching.b Socrates used to say that verity⁸
and virtue were the same. Just as truth does not
grOW, so neither does virtue grow ; for it has its due
proportions and is complete. You need not, there-
fore, wonder that goods are equal, ‘l both those which
are to be deliberately chosen, and those which
circumstances have imposed. For if 3ou once adopt
the view that they are unequal, deerning, for in-
stance, a brave endurance of tortuie as among the
lesser goodS, you will be including it among the
evils als0; you will pronounce Socrates unhappy in
his prison, Cato unhappy when he reopens his
wounds with more courage than he showed in

although, as Seneca here maintains, circumstances may
bring one or another of them into fuller play.
