EPISTLE LXXVI.

willed. It is this that is called virtue3 this is what
we mean by ‘⁶ honou1·able”<1=; it is man’s unique
good. For since reason alone brings man to per-
fection, reason alone, when perfected, makes man
happy. This, moreover‚ is man's only good, the
only means by which he is made happy. We do
indeed say that those things also ἶ) are goods which
are furthered and brought together by virtue‚—that

which arouse our desires, depress the soul and
weaken it, and when we think that they are uplifting
the soul‚ they are merely puffing it up and cheating
it with much emptiness. Therefore, that alone is
good which will make the soul better.

All the actions of life, taken as a whole, are con-

particular thing. I shall explain what Ι mean: A
good man will do what he thinks it will be honour-
able for him to do, even if it involves toil; he will
do it even if it involves harm to him; he will do it
even if it involves peril; again, he will not do that
which will be base, even if it brings him money, or
pleasure, or power. Nothing will deter him from
that which is honourable, and nothing will tempt him
into baseness. Therefore, if he is determined invari-
ably to follow that which is honourable, invariably
to avoid baseness‚ and in every act of his life to
have regard for these two things, deeming nothing
