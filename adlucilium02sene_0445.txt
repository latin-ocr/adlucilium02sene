EPISTLE XCI.

it? WVhen weapons are everywhere at rest, and
when peace prevails throughout the world, Lyons,
the pride of Gaulfl is missing!

Fortune has usually allowed all men, when she
has assailed them collectively, to have a foreboding
of that which they were destined to suffer. Every
great creation has had granted to it a period of
reprieve before its fall ; but in this case, only a single
night elapsed between the city at its greatest and
the city non—existent. In short, it takes me longer
to tell you it has perished than it took for the city
to perish.

All this has affected our friend Liberalis, bending
his will, which is usually so steadfast and erect in
the face of his own trials. And not without reason
has he been shaken3 for it is the unexpected that
puts the heaviest load upon us. Strangeness adds
to the weight of calamities, and every mortal feels
the greater pain as a result of that which also brings
surprise.

Therefore, nothing ought to be unexpected by us.
Our minds should be sent forward in advance to
meet all problems, and we should consider, not what
is wont to happen, but what can happen. For what
is there in existence that Fortune, when she has so
willed, does not drag down from the very height of
its prosperity? And what is there that she does
not the more violently assail the more brilliantly it
shines? What is laborious or difficult for her ? She
does not always attack in one way, or even with her
full strength3 at one time she summons our own
hands against us3 at another time, content with her
own powerS, she makes use of no agent in devising
perils for us. No time is exempt; in the midst of
our very pleasures there spring up causes of suffering.
