EPISTLE LXXXVII.

things are not goods.'’ “But‚” says the objector,
“ by such reasoning, things which are the gift of
Fortune will not even be advantages.” No, advantages
and goods stand each in a different situation. An
advantage is that which contains more of usefulness
than of annoyance. But a good ought to be unmixed
and with no clement in it of harmfulness. A thing
is not good if it contains more benefit than injury,
but only isit contains nothing but benefit. Besides,
advantages may be predicated of animals, of men
who are less than perfect, and of fools. Hence the
advantageous may have an clement of disadvantage
mingled with it, but the word “advantageous'’ is
used of the compound because it is judged by its
predominant clement. The good, however, can be
predicated of the wise man alone ; it is bound to be
without alloy,

Be of good cheer3 there is only one knota left
for you to untangle, though it is a knot for a
Hercules: “Good does not result from evil. But
riches result from numerous cases of poverty3 there-
fore, riches are not a good.” This syllogism is not
recognized by our school, but the Peripatetics both
concoct it and give its solution. Posidonius, how-
ever, r·emaiks that this fallacy, which has been
bandied about among all the schools of dialectic, is
refuted b) Antipateib as follows: “The wmd
‘poverty’ is used to denote, not the possession' of
something, but the non-possession or, as the ancients
have put it, deprivation, (for the Greeks use the
phrase ‘ by deprivation,' meaning ‘negatively’).
‘ Poverty’ states, not what a man has, but what he
has not. Consequently there can be no fulness
resulting from a multitude of voids3 many positive
thingS, and not many deficiencies, make up richeS.
