EPISTLE LXXIV.

“preferred’' thingsfl Let us, however, recognize
that they are our chattels, not parts of ourselves ; and
let us have them in our possession, but take heed to
remember that they are outside ourselves. Even
though they are in our possession, they are to
be reckoned as things subordinate and poor, the
possession of which gives no man a right to plume

prosperity gently. The rest all fall, together with
the things amid which they have come into eminence,
and they are weighted down by the very things
which had before exalted them. F01 this reason

things, since licence ov erthrows and destroys its own
abundance. That which has no limit has never
endured‚ unless reason, which sets limits, has held it
in check. The fate of many cities will prove the
truth of this; empircs have fallen at their very
prime because they were given to luxury, and excess
has ruined all that had been won by virtue. We
