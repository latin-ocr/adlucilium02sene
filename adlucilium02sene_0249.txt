EPISTLE LXXXI.

deserved well of him, except in cases where the
bad deeds far outdistance the good, and the space
between them is obvious even to one who closes his
eyes to it3 even then only to this extent, that he
strives, after receiving the preponderant injury, to
resume the attitude which he held before he received

after we have received it. Do you ask what it is
that makes us forget benefits received? It is our
extreme greed for receiving others. We consider
not what we have obtained, but what we are to
seek. ive are deflected from the right course by
3 riches, titles, power, and everything which is valuable
