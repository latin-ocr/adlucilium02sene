EPISTLE LXXIV.

upright men often suffer misfortunes,“ and that the
time which is allotted to us is but short and scanty,
if you compare it with the eternity which is allotted
to the universe.

It is a result of complaints like these that we are
unappreciative in our comments upon the gifts of
heaven; we complain because they are not always
granted to us, because they are few and unsure and
fleeting. Hence we have not the will either to live
or to die; we are possessed by hatred of life,
by fear of death. Our plans are all at sea, and no
amount of prosperity can satisfy us. And the reason
for all this is that we have not yet attained to that
good which is immeasurable and unsurpassable, in
which all wishing on our part must cease, because
there is no place beyond the highest. Do you ask
why virtue needs nothing? Because it is pleased
with what it has, and does not lust after that which
it has not. Whatever is enough is abundant in the
eyes of virtue.

Dissent from this judgment, and duty and loyalty
will not abide. For one who desires to exhibit these
two qualities must endure much that the world calls
evil; we must sacrifice many things to which we
are addicted, thinking them to be goods Gone is
courage, which should be continually testing itself3
gone is greatness of soul, which cannot stand out
clearly unless it has learned to scorn as trivial every-
thing that the crowd covets as supremely important ;
and gone is kindness and the repaying of kindness,
if we fear toil, if we have acknowledged anything
to be more precious than loyalty, if our eyes are
fixed upon anything except the best.

But to pass these questions by: either these so-
called goods are not goods, or else man is more
