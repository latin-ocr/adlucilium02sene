EPISTLE LXVII.

the middle of summer. Accordingly, Ι spend most
of the time bundled up; and I thank old age for
keeping me fastened to my bed.‘¹ Why should Ι not
thank old age on this account? That which Ι ought
not to wish to do, Ι lack the ability to do. Most
of my converse is with books. W henev er your
letters arlive, Ι imagine that I am with 3011, and Ι
have the feeling that I am about to speak my answ er,
instead of writing it. Therefore let us together
investigate the nature of this problem of Jours, just
as if we were conv ersing with one another b

You ask me whether every good is desirahle.
You say:‘ ‘If it is a good to be brave under torture,
to go to the stake with a stout heart, to eudure
illness with resignation, it follows that these things
are desii-able. But Ι (10 not see that any of them is
worth praying for. At any rate 1 have as yet known
of no man who has paid 3 vow by reason of having
been cut to pieces by the rod, or twisted out of
shape by the gout, or made tiller by the r ack.' My
dear Lucilius, you must distinguish between these
cases; you will then comprehend that there is
something in them that is to be desii-ed. 1 should
prefer to be free from tortu1e3 but if the time comes
when it must be endured, Ι shall desire th1t 1 may
conduct myself therein with 1)]3ιεῑι, honour, and
courage. Of course I prefer that ιι3ι should not
occur; but if war does occur, I shall desire that I may
nobly endure the wounds, the starvation, and all that
the exigency of war brings. Nor ain I so mad as to
crave illness ; but ifI must suffer illness, Ι shall desire
that 1 may do nothing which shows lack of restraint,
and nothing that is unlnanly. The conclusion is, not
that hardships are desirable, but that virtue is desir-
able, which enables us patiently to endure hardships.
