EPISTLE LXXXVIII.

aid us and yet are not parts of ourselves. Nay, if
they were, they woqu not aid us. Food is an aid
to the body, but is not a part of it. We get some
help from the service which mathematics renders;
and mathematics is as indispensable to philosophy
as the carpenter is to the mathematician. But
carpentering is not a part of mathematics, nor is
mathematics a part of philosophy. Moreover, each
has its own limits ; for the wise man investigates and
learns the causes of natural phenomena, while the
mathematician follows up and computes their
numbers and their measurementsf‘ The wise man
knows the laws by which the heavenly bodies
persist, what powers belong to them, and what
attributes; the astronomer merely notes their
comings and goings, the rules which govern their
settings and their risings, and the occasional periods
during which they seem to stand still, although as
a matter of fact no heavenly body can stand still.
The wise man will know what causes the reflection
in a mirror3 but the mathematician can merely tell
you how far the body should be from the reflection,
and what shape of mirror will produce a given
reflections’ The philosopher will demonstrate that
the sun is a large body, while the astronomer will
compute just how large, progressing in knowledge
by his method of trial and experiinent3 but in order
to progress, he must sunnnon to his aid certain
principles. No art, however, is sufficient unto itself,
if the foundation upon which it rests depends upon
mere favour. Now philosophy asks no favours from
any other source3 it builds everything on its own
soil; but the science of numbers is, so to speak, a
structure built on another inan’s land—it builds on
alien soil.c It accepts first principles, and by their
