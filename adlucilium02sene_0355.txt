nothing else than a false show of greatness.

“riches are not only not a good, but are a positive

nay, on the contrary, far more like the reality is
that vision which is flashed by virtue upon the
spirits of men, summoning them to love it and
marvel thereat.

are evils. But things which are the gift of Fortune
drive us into these evil ways. Therefore these
