EPISTLE LXVI.

ments. Constaney cannot advance further, any
more than fidelity, or truthfulness, or loyalty. What
can be added to that which is perfect? Nothing3
otherwise that was not perfect to which something
has been added. Nor can anything be added to
virtue, either, for if anything can be added
thei-eto, it must have contained a defect. Honour,
also, permits of no addition; for it is honourable
because of the very qualities which Ι have nien—

justice, lawfulness, do not also belong to the same
type, and that they are kept within fixed limits?
The ability to increase is proof that a thing is still
imperfect.

The good, in every instance, is subject to these
same laws. The advantage of the state and that of
the individual are yoked together; indeed it is as
impossible to separate them as to separate the
colnmendable from the desirable. Therefore, virtues
are mutually equal: and so are the works of virtue,
and all men who are so fortunate as to possess these
virtues. But, since the virtues of plants and of
animals are perishable, they are also frail and fleeting
and uncertain. They spring up, and they sink down
again, and for this reason they are not rated at the
same value; but to human virtues only one rule
applies. For right reason is single and of but one

more heavenly than the heavenly. Mortal things
decay, fall, are worn out, grow up, are exhausted,
and replenished. Hence, in their case, in view of
the uncertainty of their lot, there is inequality3 but
of things divine the nature is one. Reason, however,
is nothing else than a portion of the divine spirit set
