EPISTLE LXXXVII.

My friend Maximus and Ι have been spending a
most happy period of two days, taking with us very

So my progressis still insufficient. Ι have not yet
the courage openly to acknowledge my thriftiness.
Even yet I am bothered by what other travellers
think of 1116. But instead of this, Ι should really
