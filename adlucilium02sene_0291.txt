EPISTLE LXXXIV.

pack close the flowing honey,
And swell 'cheir cells with nectar sweet.‘¹

It is not certain whether the juice which they obtain
from the flowers forms at once into honey, or whether
they change that which they have gathered into this
delicious object by blending something therewith and
by a certain property of their breath. For some
authorities believe that bees do not possess the art
of making honey, but only of gathering it ; and they
say that in India honey has been found on the leaves
of certain reeds, produced by a dew peculiar to that
climate, or by the juice of the reed itself, which has
an unusual sweetness and richnessfl And in our own
grasses too, they say, the same quality exists,
although less clear and less evident; and a creature
born to fulfil such a function could hunt it out and
collect it. Certain others maintain that the materials
which the bees have culled from the most delicate of
blooming and flowering plants is transformed into
this peculiar substance by a process of preserving and
careful storing away, aided by what might be called
fermentation,-—whereby separate elements are united
into one substance.

But I must not be led astray into another subject
than that which we are discussing. &Ve also, I say,
ought to copy these bees, and sift whatever we have
gathered from a varied course of reading, for such
things are better preserved if they are kept separate ;
then, by applying the supervising care with which our
nature has endowed us,——in other words, our natural
gifts, —we should so blend those several flavours into
one delicious compound that, ev en though it betrays
its origin, yet it nev ertheless is clearly a different
thing from that whence it c a.me T his is w hat we see
nature doing in our own bodies without any labour
