EPISTLE LXXI.

The archer must know what he is secking to
hit3 then he must aim and control the weapon by
his skill. Our plans miscarry because they have no
aim. W hen a man does not know what harbour he
is making for, no wind is the right wind. Chance
must necessarily have great influence over our lives,
because we live by chance. It is the case with
certain men, however, that they do not know that
they know certain things. Just as we often go

To infer the nature of this Supreine Good, one

mind than your very torture1·; illness, if only you
curse not Fortune and yield not to the disease——in
short, all those things which others regard as ills
will become manageable and will end in good, if you
succeed in rising above them.

Let this once be clear, that there is nothing good
except that which is honourable, and all hardships
will have a just title to the name of “ goods,'’ when
