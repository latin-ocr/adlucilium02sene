EPISTLE XCI.

comprehended by a madman, who let his thoughts
range beyond the 0663110ι “Teach me something
easy!'’ he cries; but his teacher answers: “These
things are the same for all, as hard for one as for
another.³ ’ Imagine that nature is saying to us:

“Those things of which you complain are the same
for all. I cannot give any thing easier to any man, but
whoev er 11151165 will make things easier for 1111115611“.”
ln what way? By equanimity. You must suffer
pain, and thirst, and hunger, and old age too, if a
longer stay among men shall be granted you; you
must be sick, and you must suffer loss and death.
Nevertheless, you should not believe those whose
noisy clamour surrounds you; 110116 of these things
is an evil, none is beyond your power to bear, or is
burdensome. It is only by common opinion that
there is anything formidable in them. Your fearing
death is therefore like your sear of gossip. But
what is more foolish than a man afraid of words?
Our friend Demetriusb is wont to put it cleverly
when he says: “For 1116 the talk of ignorant men
is like the rumblings which issue from the belly.
For‚” he adds, “ what difference does it make to me
whether such rumblings come from above 01· from
below?” What madness it is to be afraid of dis-
repute in the judgment of the disreputable! Just
as you have had no cause for shrinking in terror
from the talk of men, 50 you have no cause now to
shrink from these things, which you would never
fear had not their talk forced fear upon you. Does
it do any 1131111 to 3 good man to be besmirched by
unjust gossip? Then let not this sort of thing
damage death, either, in our estimation; death also
is in bad odour. But no one of those who malign
death has made trial of it.
