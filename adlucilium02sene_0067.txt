EPISTLE LXIX.

used to crave so passionately, must turn away both
eyes and ears from the objects which he has aban-
doned. The emotions soon return to the attack3
at every turn they will notice before their eyes an
object worth their attention. There is no evil that
does not offer inducements. Avarice promises
money3 luxury, a varied assortment of pleasures;
ambition, a purple robe and applause, and the
influence which results from applause, and all that
influence can do. vices tempt you by the rewards
which they offer3 but in the life of which Ι speak,
you must live without being paid. Scarcely will a
whole life-time suffice to bring our vices into subjec-
tion and to make them accept the yoke, swollen as
they are by long-continued indulgence; and still
less, if we cut into our brief span by any interrup-
tions. Even constant care and attention can scarcely
bring any one undertaking to full coxnpletion. lf
you will give ear to my advice, ponder and practise
this,-how to welcome death, or even, if circuni-
stances commend that course, to invite it. There is
no difference whether death comes to us, or whether
we go to death. Make yourself believe that all
ignorant men are wrong when they Say: “It is a
beautiful thing to die one’ s own deaths a But there
is no man who does not die his own death. What
is more, you may reflect on this thought: No one
dies except on his own day. You are throwing away
none of your own tin1e; for what you leave behind
does not belong to you. Farewell.
