EPISTLE LXXI.

once virtue has made them honourable. Many
think that we Stoics are holding out expectations
greater than our human lot admits of; and they
have a right to think so. For they have regard to
the body only. But let them turn back to the soul,
and they will soon measure man by the standard of
God. Rouse yourself, most excellent Lucilius, and
leave off all this word-play of the philosophers,
who reduce a most glorious subject to a matter of
syllableS, and lower and wear out the soul by teach-
ing fragments3 then you will become like the men
who discovered these precepts‚ instead of those who
by their teaching do their best to make philosophy
seem difficult rather than great.a

Socrates, who recalledb the whole of philosophy
to rules of conduct, and asserted that the highest
wisdom consisted in distinguishing between good and
evil, said: “Follow these rules, if my words carry
weight with you, in order that you may be happy;
and let some men think you even a fool. Allow
any man who so desires to insult you and work you
wrong3 but if only virtue dwells with you, you will
suffer nothing. If you wish to be happy, if you
would be in good saith a good man,c let one person or
another despise you.'' No man can accomplish this
unless he has come to regard all goods as equal, for
the reason that no good exists without that which is
honourable, and that which is honourable is in every
case equal. You may say : ‘⁶ What then? Is there
no difference between Cato’s being elected praetor
and his failure at the polls? Or whether Cato is
conquered or conqueror in the battle-line of Phar-
salia? And when Cato could not be defeated,
though his party met defeat, was not this goodness
of his equal to that which would have been his if
