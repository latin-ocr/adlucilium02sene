EPISTLE XCI.

and should fortify our ininds against the evils which
may possibly come. Exile, the torture of disease,
wars, shipwreck,——we must think on thesest Chance
may tear you from your country or your country
from you, or may banish you to the desert; this
very place, where throngs are stifling, may become
a desert. Let us place before our eyes in its
entirety the nature of lnan’s lot, and if we would
not be overwhelmed, or even dazed, by those un-
wonted evils, as if they were novel, let us summon
to our minds beforehand, not as great an evil as
oftentimes happenS, but the very greatest evil that
possibly can happen. W'e must reflect upon fortune
fully and completely.

How often have cities in Asia, how often in
Achaia, been laid low by a single shock of earth-
quake! How many towns in Syria, how many in
Macedonia, have been swallowed up! How often
has this kind of devastation laid Cyprusb in ruins!
How often has Paphos collapsed! Not infrequently
are tidings brought to us of the utter destruction of
entire cities; yet how small a part of the world are
we, to whom such tidings often come ἶ

Let us rise, therefore, to confront the operations
of Fortune, and whatever happens, let us have the
assurance that it is not so great as rumour advertises
it to be. A rich city has been laid in ashes, the
jewel of the provinces, counted as one of them and
yet not included with them⁶; rich though it was,
nevertheless it was set upon a single hill,d and that

three Gallie provinces; it was a free town, belonging to
none and yet their capital, much like the city of Washington
in relation to the United States.

a A fact mentioned merely to suggest Rome with her
seven hills.
