thrift and economy, and that kindliness which spares

that it is not for man to make wasteful use of his

without food, either; and yet food has nothing to
do with virtue. Wood does not offer assistance to
a ship, although a ship cannot be built except of
wood. There is no reason, I say, why you should
think that anything is made by the assistance of
that without which it cannot be made. We might
even make the statement that it is possible to
attain wisdom without the “liberal studies’'; for
although virtue is a thing that must be learned, yet
it is not learned by means of these studies.

What reason have I, however, for supposing
that one who is ignorant of letters will never
be a wise man, since wisdom is not to be found
in letters? Wisdom communicates factsb and not
words3 and it may be true that the memory is
more to be depended upon when it has no support
outside itself. Wisdom is a large and spacious
thing. It needs plenty of free room. One must
learn about things divine and human, the past
and the future, the ephemeral and the eternal3
