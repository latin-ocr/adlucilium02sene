EPISTLE LXXVII.

weighing were a matter of importance. It is not an
important matter to live, · all your slaves live, and so
do all animals3 but it is imp01 tant to die honour-,ably
sensibly, bravely. Reflect how long you have been
doing the same thing: food, sleep, lust, —this is
one' s daily round. The desire to die may be felt,
not only by the sensible man or the brave or unhappy
man, but even by the man who is merely surfeited.''

Marcellinus did not need someone to urge him,
but rather someone to help him; his slaves refused
to do his bidding. The Stoic therefore removed
their fears, showing them that there was no risk
involved for the household except when it was un-
certain whether the master's death was self-sought
or not, · besides, it was as bad a practice to prevent
one’s mastel from killing himself as it was to kill
him. Then he suggested& to Marcellinus himself that
it would be a kindly act to distribute gifts to those
who had attended him throughout his whole life,
when that life was finished, just 13, when a banquet
is finished‚ a the remaining portion is divided among
the attendants who stand about the ta.ble Mar—
cellinus was of a compliant and generous disposition,
even when it was a question of his own property3 so
he distributed little sums among his sorrowing slaves,
and comforted them besides. No need had he of
sword or of bloodshed ; for three days he fasted and
had a tent put up in his very bedroom.b Then a
tub was brought in; he lay in it for a long time,
and, as the hot water was continually poured over
him, he gradually passed away, not without a feeling
of pleasure, as he himself remarked,—such a feeling
as a slow dissolution is wont to give. Those of us
who have ever fainted know from experience what
this feeling is.
