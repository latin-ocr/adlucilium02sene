EPISTLE LXXI.

latter is situated man’s Supreme Good. Before this
is completely attained, the mind wavers in uncer-
tainty3 only when it is fully achieved is the mind
fixed and steady. And so when one has just begun,
or is on one’s way to the heights and is cultivating
virtue, or even if 0116 15 drawing near the perfect

existence. The wise 111311, indeed, overcomes F ortune

ζ by his virtue, but many who profess wisdoni are

sometimes frightened by the most unsubstantial
threats. And at 11115 stage it is 3 mistake on our
