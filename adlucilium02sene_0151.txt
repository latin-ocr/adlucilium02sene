EPISTLE LXXV.

I prefer, however, that our conversation on matters
so important should not be meagre and dry; for
even philosophy does not renounce the company of
cleverness. One should not, however, bestow very
much attention upon mere words. Let this be the
kernel of my idea: let us say what we feel, and feel
what we say; let speech harmonize with lifefl That
man has fulfilled his promise who is the same person
both when you see him and when you hear him.
We shall not fail to see what sort of man he is and
how large a man he is, if only he is one and the
same. Our words should aim not to please, but to
help. If, however, you can attain eloquence without
painstaking, and if you either are naturally gifted or
can gain eloquence at slight eost, make the most of
it and apply it to the noblest uses. But let it be of
such a kind that it displays facts rather than itself.
It and the other arts are wholly concerned with
cleverness l’; but our business here is the soul.

A sick man does not call in a physician who is
eloquent; but if it so happens that the physic-ian
who can cure him likewise discourses elegantly about
the treatment which is to be followed, the patient
will take it in good part. For all that, he will not
find any reason to congratulate himself on having
discovered a physician who is eloquent. For the
case is no different from that of a skilled pilot who
is also handsoine. Why do vou tickle my ears?
Why do you entertain me. Ρ There is othei business
at hand; Ι am to be cauterized, operated upon, or
put on a diet. That is why you were summoned to
treat me!

You are required to cure a disease that is chronic
and serious,—one which affects the general weal.
You have as serious a business on hand as a physician
