EPISTLE LXVI.

absence of pain? The soul is composed and calm3
what increase can there be to this tranquillity? Just
as fair weather, purified into the purest brilliancy,
does not admit of a still greater degree of clearness3
so, when a man takes care of his body and of his soul,
weaving the texture of his good from both, his con-

not happen, he nevertheless praises and appi-oves,—
for example, the kind of resignation, in times of 111-
health and serious suffering, to which Ι alluded a
moment ago, and which Epicurus displayed on that
last and most blessed day of his life. For he tells
us b that he had to endure excruciating agony from a
diseased bladder and from an ulcerated stomach,——
so acute that it permitted no increase of pain3 “ and
yet,'' he says, “that day was none the less happy‚”
And no man can spend such a day in happiness
unless he possesses the Supreme Good.

We therefore find mentioned, even by Epicurus,c
those goods which one would prefer not to experience3
which, however, because circumstances have decided
