EPISTLE LXXXVIII.

these conteinptible vomiters of our day, whose bodies
are fed to fatness while their minds are thin and
(ΙΠΠΡίι Or do we really believe that the training
which they give is “liberal” for the young men of
Rome, who used to be taught by our ancestors to
stand straight and hurl a spear, to wield a pike,
to guide a horse, and to handle weapons? Oui·
ancestors used to teach their children nothing that
could be learned while lying down. But neither
the new system nor the old teaches or nourishes
virtue. For what good does it do us to guide a
horse and control his speed with the curb, and then
find that our own passions, utterly uncurbed, bolt
with us? Or to beat many opponents in wrestling
or boxing, and then to find that we ourselves are
beaten by anger?

“What then‚” you say, ‘⁶ do the liberal studies

contribute nothing to our welfare ? '' V ery much in ’

other respects, but nothing at all as regards virtue.
For even these arts of which I have spoken, though
admittedly of a low grade—depending as they do
upon handiwork—-contribute greatly toward the
equipment of life, but nevertheless have nothing to
do with virtue. And if you inquire, “ Why, then,
do we educate our children in the liberal studies ? '’ ἶ)
it is not because they can bestow virtue, but because
they prepare the soul for the reception of virtue.
Just as that “primary course,''C as the ancients
called it, in grammar, which gave boys their
elementary training, does not teach them the liberal
arts, but prepares the ground for their early acquisi-
tion of these arts, so the liberal arts do not conduct
the soul all the way to virtue, but merely set it
going· in that direction.
