EPISTLE LXXX.

more easily might the mind be toughened so that it
could receive the blows of F ortune and not be con-

after it has been laid low, after it has been trampled

For although the body needs many things in
order to be strong, yet the mind grows from within,

without expense. All that goes to make you a good
man lies within yourself. And what do you need in
order to become good? To wish it. But what
better thing could you wish for than to break away
from this slavery,——a slavery that oppresses us all, a
slavery which even chattels of the lowest estate, born
amid such degradation, strive in every possible way
to strip off? In exchange for freedom they pay out
the savings which they have scraped together by
cheating their own bellies; shall you not be eager to
attain liberty at any price, seeing that you claim it
as your birthright? Why cast glances toward your
strong-box? Liberty cannot be bought. It is
therefore useless to enter in your ledgera the item
of “Freed0m‚” for freedom is possessed neither by
those who have bought it nor by those who have
sold it. You must give this good to yourself, and
seek it from yourself.

[ yourself from the fear of poverty. If you would
, know how little evil there is in poverty, compare the

faces of the poor with those of the rich3 the poor
