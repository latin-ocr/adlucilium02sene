EPISTLE XCII.

If you are not contented with only that which is
honourable, it must follow that you desire in addition
either the kind of quiet which the Greeks call
“ undisturbedness,’' or else pleasure. But the former
may be attained in any case. For the inind is free
from disturbance when it is fully free to contemplate
the universe, and nothing distracts it from the con-
templation of nature. The second, pleasure, is simply
the good of cattle. We are but adding a the irrational
to the rational, the dishonourable to the honourable.
A pleasant physical sensation affects this life of oul·s;
why, therefore, do you hesitate to say that all is well
with a man just because all is well with his appetite?
And do you rate, I will not say among heroes, but
among men, the person whose Supreme Good is a
matter of flavours and colours and sounds? Nay,
let him withdraw from the ranks of this, the noblest
class of living beingS‚ second only to the gods; let
him herd with the dumb brutes—an animal whose
delight is in fodder!

The irrational part of the soul is twofoldb: the
one part is spirited, ambitious, uncontrolled ; its seat
is in the passions; the other is lowly, sluggish, and
devoted to pleasure. Philosophers have neglected
the former, which, though unbridled‚ is yet better,
and is certainly more cour-ageous and more worthy
of a man, and have regarded the latter, which
is nerveless and ignoble, as indispensable to the
happy life. They have ordered reason to serve this
latter3 they have made the Supreme Good of the
noblest living being an abject and mean affair, and
a monstrous hybrid, too, composed of various members

either the first or the second. See his Republica 440.
