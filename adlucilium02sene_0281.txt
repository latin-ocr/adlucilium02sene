EPISTLE LXXXIII.

orderS, written in his own hand,—orders which 116
believed he ought not to trust even to the officials of
his household. Cossus never let a single secret slip
out, whether personal or public.

So let us abolish all such harangues as this: ‘⁶ No
man in the bonds of drunkenness has power over his
soul. As the very vats are burst by new wine, and
as the dregs at the bottoin are raised to the surface
by the strength of the fermentation3 so, when the wine
effervesces, whatever lies hidden below is brought up
and made visible. As a man overcome by liquor can-
not keepdown his food when 116 has over-indulged in
wine, so he cannot keep back a secret either. He
pours forth impartially both his own secrets and those
of other persons.'' This, of course, is what commonly
happens, but so does this,——that we take counsel on
serious subjects with those whom we know to be in
the habit of drinking freely. Therefore this proposi-
tion, which is laid down in the guise of a defence
of Zeno‘s syllogism, is false,——that secrets are not
entrusted to the habitual drunkard.

How much better it is to arraign drunkenness
frankly and to expose its vices! For even the
middling good man avoids them, not to mention the
perfect sage, who is satisfied with slaking his thirst ;
the sage, even if now and then he is led on by good
cheer which, for a friend's sake, is carried somewhat
too far, yet always stops short of drunkenness. We
shall investigate later the question whether the mind
of the sage is upset by too much wine and commits
follies like those of the toper‚ · but meanwhile, if you
wish to prove that ¹1 good man ought not to get
drunk, why work it out oby log 016 Ρ Show how base it
