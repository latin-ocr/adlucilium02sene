request, or by hope.’' Our feeling about every
obligation depends in each case upon the spirit in
which the benefit is conferred3 we weigh not the

for a benefit3 even a thoughtless, crude fellow, one
of the common herd, may know, especially soon
after he has received the gift; but he does not know
how deeply he stands in debt therefor. Only the
wise man knows exactly what value should be put
