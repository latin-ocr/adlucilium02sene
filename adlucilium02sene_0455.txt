EPISTLE XCI.

not cry out at any of these calainities. Into such a
world have we entered, and under such laws do we
live. If you like it, obey; if not, depart whitherso-
ever you wish. Cry out 111 anger if any unfair
measures are taken with reference to you individu-
ally; but if this inevitable law is binding upon the
highest and the lowest alike, be reconciled to
fate, by which all things are dissolved. You should
not estimate our worth by our funeral inounds or
by these monuments of unequal size which line the
road3 their ashes level all men! We are unequal
at bir,th but are equal in death. W hat I say

founder of human law has not made distinctions

he says: ‘⁶ Depart, alnbition! ΤΟ all crcatures that
burden the earth let one and the same b law apply ! ”
For enduring all things, we are equal; no one is
more frail than another, no one more certain of his
own life on the morrow.

geometry ⁶ 3 unhappy man, because he would thereby
learn how puny was that earth of which he had seized
but a fraction! Unhappy man, I repeat, because
he was bound to understand that he was bearing a
false title. For who can be “great ’' in that which
is puny? The lessons which were being taught
him were intricate and could be learned only by
assiduous application3 they 11 ere not the kind to be

legal term, is derived by Festus from simili-s· re ipsa3 but
Corssen explains it as from sie rem pse
