EPISTLE LXXI.

so much progress that he is able to match glauces
with her,-—that is, unless he has already reached the
summit and is full of confidencefl That which is
short of perfectiori must necessarily be unsteady, at
one time progressing, at another slipping or growing
faint3 and it will surely slip back unless it keeps
struggling ahead; for if a man slackens at all in zeal
and faithful application, he must retrograde. No
one can resume his progress at the point where he
left off. Therefore let us press on and persevere.
There remains much more of the road than we have
put behind us; but the greater part of progress is
the desire to progress.

I fully understand what this task is. It is a
thing which I desire, and Ι desire it with all iny
heart. I see that you also have been aroused and
are hastening with great zeal towards infinite beauty.
Let us, then, hasten3 only on these terms will life
be a boon to us; otherwise, there is delay, and
indeed disgraceful delay, while we busy ourselves
with revolting things. Let us see to it that all time
belongs to us. This, however, cannot be unless first
of all our own selves begin to belong to us. And
when will it be our privilege to despise both kinds
of fortune? Vi'hen will it be our privilege, after
all the passions have been subdued and brought
under our own control, to utter the words “I have
conqueled!” Do you ask ine whom I haxe
conquered? 'Neither the Persians, nor the far- off
Medes, nor any warlike race that lies beyond the
Dahae⁶; not these, but greed, ambition, and the
fear of death that has conquered the conquerors of
the world. Farewell.
