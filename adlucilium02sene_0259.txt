EPISTLE LXXXII.

not easily tell you whether he who thought that
he was quenching the fear of death by setting
up this syllogism was the more foolish, or he who
attempted to refute it, just as if it had anything to
do with the matter! For the refuter himself pro-
posed a counter-syllogism‚ based upon the proposition
that we regard death as “ indifferent,”——one of the
things which the Greeks call ἁδι(ἱφορα.“ ·’·’ Nothing,''
he says, ‘·' that is indifferent can be glorious; death is

except as it deals with indifferent things. I classify

man whom pain has not coerced. One praises
not death, but the man whose soul death takes

are in themselves neither honourable nor glorious 3
but any one of them that virtue has visited and
touched is made honour-able and glorious by
virtue ; they merely lie in l›etween,b and the
decisive question is only whether wickedness or
virtue has laid hold upon them. For instance, the
death which in Cato's case is glorious, is in the case
