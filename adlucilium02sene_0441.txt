EPISTLE XC.

these days, however, our houses constitute a large
portion of our dread.

But no matter how excellent and guileless was
the life of the men of that age, they were not wise
men; for that title is reserved for the highest
achievement. Still, I would not deny that they
were men of lofty spirit and—if I may use the

trained and taught, and by unreniitting practice
brought to perfection. For the attainment of this
boon, but not in the possession of it, were we born ;
