EPISTLES LXVII„ LXVIII.

to the stake, Ι shall go unbeaten. Why should I
not regard this as desirable—not because the fire
burns me, but because it does not overcome me?
Nothing is more excellent or more beautiful than
virtue ; any command given by her is both good and
desirable. Farewell.

LXVIII. ΟΝ WISDOM AND RETIREMENT

I fall in with your plan; retire and conceal your-
self in repose. But at the same time conceal your
retirement also. In doing this, you may be sure
that you will be following the example of the
Stoics, if not their precept. But you will be acting
according to their precept also; you will thus satisfy
both yourself and any Stoic you please. W'e Stoics a
do not urge men to take up public life in every case,
or at all times, or without any qualification. Resides,
when we have assigned to our wise man that field of
public life which is worthy of hiin,—in other words,
the universe,—he is then not apart from public life,
even if he withdraws ; nay, perhaps he has abandoned
only one little corner thereof and has passed over
into greater and wider regions; and when he has
been set in the heavens, he under-stands how lowly
was the place in which he sat when he mounted the
curule chair or the judgment-seat. Lay this to heart,
——that the wise man is never more active in affairs
than when things divine as well as things human
have corne within his ken.

I now return to the advice which I set out to give

of this topic in Seneca see Ep. lxxiii. 1 ff. Seneca's argu-
ments are coloured by the facts of his life at this time.
