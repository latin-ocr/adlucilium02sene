EPISTLE LXVI.

It is because nothing can be more fitting than that
which is fitting, and nothing more level than that
which is level. You cannot say that one thing is
more equal to a given object than another thing3
hence also nothing is more honour-able than that which
is honourable. Accordingly, if all the virtues are by
nature equal, the three varieties α of goods are equal.
This is what I mean: there is an equality between
feeling joy with sels-control and suffering pain with
sels-control. The joy in the 0118 case does not sur-

and grand to the gaze.

Yes, my dear Lucilius, the good which true reason
approves is solid and everlasting3 it strengthens
the spirit and exalts it, so that it will always be 011
the heights; but those things which are thought—
lessly praised, and are goods in the opinion of the
mob, merely puff us up with empty joy. And again,
those things which are feared as if they were evils
