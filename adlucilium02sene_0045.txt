EPISTLE LXVI.

thus, must be welcomed and approved and placed on
a level with the highest goods. We cannot say that
the good which has rounded outa a happy life, the
good to which Epicurus rendered thanks in the last
words he uttered, is not equal to the greatest. Allow
me, excellent Lucilius, to utter a still holder word:
if any goods could be greater than others, Ι should

and shrivelled hand of Mucius ⁰ than to the uninjured
hand of the bravest man in the world? There stood
Mucius, despising the enemy and despising the fire,
and watched his hand as it dripped blood over the
fire on his enemy's altar, until Porsenna, envying the
fame of the hero whose punishment he was advocat-
ing, ordered the fire to be removed against the
will of the victim.

Why should I not reckon this good among the
primary goods, and deem it in so far greater than
