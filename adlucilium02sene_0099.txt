EPISTLE LXXI.

created by virtue be in one case straighter and in
another less straight. For they must necessarily
correspond to virtue3 hence they are equal.
“What,” you say, “do you call reclining at a
banquet and submitting to torture equally good?’'
Does this seem surprising to you? You may be still
more surprised at the following—that reclining at

be routed from their beds at break of day. These
