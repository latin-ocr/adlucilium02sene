EPISTLE LXXXV.

alter the earlier habit of a mind that was formerly
free from anger. Besides, if the wise man, instead
of despising all causes that come from without, ever
fears anything, when the time arrives for him to go
bravely to meet the spear, or the flames, on behalf
of his country, his laws, and his liberty, he will go
forth reluctantly and with flagging spirit. Such
inconsistency of mind, however, does not suit the
character of a wise man.

Then, again, we should see to it that two
principles which ought to be tested separately should
not be confused. For the conclusion is reached
independently that that alone is good which is
honourable, and again independently the conclusion
that virtue is sufficient for the happy life. If that
alone is good which is honourable, everyone agrees
that virtue is sufficient for the purpose of living
happily, but, on the contrary, if virtue alone makes
men happy, it will not be conceded that that alone
is good which is honourable. Xenocratesa and
Speusippusa hold that a man can become happy
even by virtue alone, not, however, that that which
is honourable is the only good. Epicurus also
decides ὓ that one who possesses virtue is happy, but
that virtue of itself is not sufficient for the happy
life, because the pleasure that results from virtue,
and not virtue itself, makes one happy. This is a
futile distinction. For the same philosopher declares
that virtue never exists without pleasure3 and
therefore, if virtue is always connected with pleasure
and always inseparable thercfrom, virtue is of itself
sufficient. For virtue keeps pleasure in its company,
and does not exist without it, even when alone.
But it is absurd to say that a man will be happy
by virtue alone, and yet not absolutely happy. I
