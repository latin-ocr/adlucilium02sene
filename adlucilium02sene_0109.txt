EPISTLE LXXII.

LXXII. ΟΝ BUSINESS AS THE ENEMY
OF PHILOSOPHY

The subject a concerning which you question me
was once clear to my mind, and required no thought,
so thoroughly had Ι mastered it. But I have not
tested my mernory of it for some time, and therefore
it does not readily come back to me. Ι feel that I
have suffered the fate of a book xvhose roHs have
stuck together by disuse3 my mind needs to be
unrolled‚ and whatever has been stored away there
ought to be exauuned ᾔτηη tune to thne,so that
it may be ready for use when occasion demands.
Let us therefore put this subject off for the present3
for it demands much labour and much care. As
soon as Ι can hope to stay fior any length of tnnc
in the same place, I shall then take your question in
hand. For there are ceruum sulnjects about uluch
you can write even while travelliug in a gig, and
there are also subjects which need a study-chair,
and quiet, and seclusion. Nevertheless I ought to
accomplish something even on days like these,——
days uffuch are fitu euqssoyed,and indeed {roni
Inonung tssl1ught. Ιῆπ there Ε never a nnnnent
when fresh employments will not come along; we
sow them, and for this reason several spring up
from one. Then, too, we keep adjourning our own
cases,b saying: “As soon as I am done with this, l
shall settle down to hard work,'’ or: “ If I ever set
this troublesonue inatter in order, Ι shall devote
myself to study.’'

· But the study of philosophy is not to be postponed
until you have leisure;c everything else is to be
neglected in order that we may attend to philosophy,
